# PasswordProtect using Python(Still Under development)

Had really bad time in remembering all the passwords. And I am not comfortable with saving my passwords with 3rd part apps. 
Hence though of creating my own app for the same. I am using python here, just because I am learning it and just amazed 
about the power Python has.

Structure: 
I am still not sure weather this should be the ideal folder structure of any Python project.
Have couple of todo items which I will be listing at the end and which
  are to be completd before I can open source this/ call it completed.

Root Folder
           -Encrypt
                   - __init__.py
                   -AddtoDb.py
                   -dbconn.py
                   -encreyptdata.py
                   -my_first_db.sqlite
           -requirements.txt
           -setup.py
           -encrypt.egg-info
           


todo items:

1. Naming convection of all the files, I am not sure weather I am using the proper convection.
2. Populate data in __init__.py
3. Rename sqlite db file.
4. Put Sqlite db in the root folder.
5. Add logging info in /opt/log. Need to use some proper logger.
6. Populate requirement.txt.
7. Publish this as a python package.
