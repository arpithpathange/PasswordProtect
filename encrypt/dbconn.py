This class connects to the sqlite db for all your DB operations. I have used sqlite for now as it is easy to use.

Sqlite has following disadventages:
1. No user support
2.

Adventages of postgress:
1. Large support
2. Huge support for 3rd party , I have no idea but down the line we might integrate with some 3rd party apps.
